# Simple MySQL function foundations in bash
-------------------------------------------

Simple demonstations of working with MySQL from the bash shell.

Tested with MySQL 5.6.30-1 and bash 4.4.5 on Debian testing.
MySQL 5.7.x supports JSON.
This should work on other bash versions and MySQL versions.
Feedback is always appreciated.

## TO TEST

Be sure that MySQL is running:

` $ ps -ax | grep -i mysqld `
